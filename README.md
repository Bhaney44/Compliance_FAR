# FAR Compliance

Summary
---
This repository contains code for an automated source selection scoring system for Federal agency Federal Acquisition Regulation compliance. The bid.py file contains an initial prototype and the NewDevelopment.py is a working evolved version. The code in this repository is based upon my academic paper Automated Source Selection & FAR Compliance, which has been selected for publication in the Summer 2019 issue of the Public Procurement Law Journal published by the American Bar Association with George Washington University Law School.
